                    During my time at the Art Institute, I gained valuable experience in various disciplines. Although my major was in Graphic Design and Web Design, the institute required me to explore other areas as well. As a result, I took classes in photography principles, motion graphics, and film. Below are some projects I created during those classes. I enjoyed working on these projects and look forward to using these skills in future endeavors.

                    Having already gained experience in video editing and filming during high school and previous college projects, I was able to bring everything together for the final project in this class. For this project, I took on the roles of writer, cinematographer, and film editor. Wearing multiple hats allowed me to connect different aspects of the project. The premise behind this short film was inspired by creative culture and was somewhat of a music video that had been lingering in my mind. It was filmed on the rooftop of the Art Institute parking garage and tells the story of a guy going through a breakup with his girlfriend. The film depicts him reading the breakup text, followed by a moment of reflection, ultimately conveying the message that everything will be okay.

                    I was thrilled to take a class in motion graphics, and I couldn't wait to work on our final project. For the project, I created a monologue for a World Wildlife Fund fundraiser campaign. It was my first time using Adobe After Effects, and I had a great time playing around with it. I'm excited to continue using After Effects and working on more projects.
